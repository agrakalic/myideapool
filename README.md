Sample project for arc.dev
## Installation
This project was built using Parcel bundler. It is required to have it installed locally. If you don't have it please install it with
```bash
npm install -g parcel-bundler
```
Usually, when initializing Parcel project, we start with `init -y` and the bundler takes care of the dependencies. This project comes with pre-configured `package.json` file in order to provide some of the commands used in development and build process. So to kickstart the project first run
```bash
npm install
```
Then you will have two commands available
```bash
npm run dev
```
and
```bash
npm run build
```
First is used during the development process, it sets a watch and hot module replacement tasks running and is starts the local server. The second one compiles the entire app and make it ready for production.
